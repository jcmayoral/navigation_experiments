Required to install primitives_analysis (python setup.py install) package on the parent directory.

How to use...

Four terminals are required for running it with toru_nav_sim:
  1. roscore
  2. run toru_nav_sim simulation
  3. rosrun multi_robots_comm server.py
  4. rosrun multi_robots_comm simple_client.py

Additionally on rviz change on the tools properties the 2dnav goal topic from /move_base_simple/goal to
/move_base_simple_time/goal.

Relevant topics:

-> /move_base_simple_time/goal provides goal.
-> /trajectory_estimator publishes the poses where the robot supposes to be during motion execution (it is not fully reliable yet).

Additionally under development, it exists a multi robot coordination version of this algorithm where the robots negotiate who will performa a navigation task.
