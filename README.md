Hi!

If you are reading this you are curious enough to check my repositories in bitbucket... and well, this contains a couple of ideas which only purpose is to provide a couple of personal ideas to the company (not before testing the feasibility and satisfy my curiosity) that I developed during my internship. It contains the code that I developed to do my dutties as well. As you will figure out, this ideas are not customized for Magazino by development.

This are just first version implementation, to be honest I am not wisdow enough about all the software at the company. Some libraries are also provided on my ros_experiments repository which will be required for some of the code on the current repository

I hope this could help to anybody who will work on this topics, and my sincered regards.
