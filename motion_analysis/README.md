The ODWA project was developed in order to optimize some params on the oriented_dwa or even the original dwa implementation. It also contains some tools to visualize and command the robot autonomously to generate data without supervision. I did not remove some results generated files with the purpose that you could actually watch how the data is generated. THIS IS JUST A VERY FIRST VERSION, indeed it could be changed to optimize while moving (some sort of more advance machine learning)


The sbpl_primitives_optimizer has the same purpose of the before hand project, optimizes the primitives on terms of searching time and other optimality criteria


velocity_analyzer keeps track on the velocity controller between odom speed and commanded speed.
